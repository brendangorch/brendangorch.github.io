												<h3>Education Storage</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Education Storage is a JavaFX-based database application created using Apache Derby. The application acts as a "storage"
												that holds a student's grades throughout their 4 years of being an undergraduate. It also includes a useful GPA calculator that displays
												yearly GPAs, term GPAs, highest/lowest grades, and total credits. This calculator also allows the user to calculate specific academic
												averages by selecting the years they want to be included.

												<h3>Full-Stack Superhero Application</h3>
											</header>
											<p>While learning React, I began developing a full-stack application that allows users to create accounts, search for superheroes from
												a document containing hundreds of heroes, create custom lists of heroes, and leave reviews on other lists. I used MongoDB to store 
												all user accounts, lists, and policies that the site-admin can create. The admin can create DMCA, private use, and privacy/security
												policies which are then displayed to all users. I used Bcrypt and JWT for security of passwords and verifying emails.

												<h3>Transit-DB</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Transit-DB is a full-stack database application that I built using MySQL, Node.js, and React. A user logs in and then has access to a
												robust transit application which includes purchasing train tickets, adding funds, finding stations, finding trains, and adding favourite
												stations/routes. The database schema includes various tables and complex relationships. The SQL tables and relations were populated with 
												large amounts of random data to simulate a real-world transit application.

												<h3>Google Web Scraper</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Using JavaFX alongside jsoup, I created a simple web scraper during the summer. The application prompts the user to enter keyword(s) for
												a google search, and the number of pages to search. It then searches through the pages on google, looks at all of the websites within the page range,
												and checks various locations on each page for the keyword(s) such as title, link, description, and more. Only websites that include the keyword(s) 
												will be returned to the user in a list.

												<h3>Selection and Merge Sort Simulator</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After learning about sorting algorithms in my second-year data structures course, I created a visual simulator for selection sort and merge sort.
												This was my first time using JavaFX for GUI creation (which I then used for my future projects shown above). The application displays 16 to 128 
												rectangles, all of different sizes in random order, based on the user's selection. It then visually sorts the rectangles using one of the two
												sorting algorithms selected by the user.

												<h3>2D Slime Platformer</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My interest in game development lead me to creating a prototype for a 2D platformer. Using Godot's built in scripting lanuage GDScript, 
												I created a very simple and small game where the player controls a slime and jumps through platforms. I implemented a respawn functionality
												so if the player falls off the platforms, they spawn at the beginning. Currently, this game has no finishing objective, but I may come back
												to it in the future. I developed this game just to test out the Godot engine and GDScript.
